# Earthquake-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting earthquake magnitudes using regression techniques. The dataset contains earthquake data, including attributes like magnitude, depth, and location. The aim is to build and evaluate a regression model to predict earthquake magnitudes based on these features.

Project Overview
Dataset: The project uses earthquake data from a dataset containing information on earthquakes worldwide. The data includes various features such as magnitude, depth, latitude, longitude, and location.

Goal: The main objective is to use regression analysis to predict the magnitude of earthquakes based on the available data.

Approach: The project explores different regression models to predict earthquake magnitudes. The models' performance is evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²).
